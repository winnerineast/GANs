# GANs
this is the implementations and papers of Generative Adversarial Networks

# Background
### I used to working on supervised machine learning to classify text in various types. Convolutional Nerual Network (CNN) is my favorit because it's simple comparing with other type of nerual network and stable and fast for word embeddings. But it's hard to find out tagged text as training data set, so I really want to have something new to learn the text without many tagged text. That's why I have interest in GANs.

# What's here
### I put the papers I read here along the time and also will try to implement the algorithm based on the papers.
